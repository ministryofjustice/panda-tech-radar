<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Platforms and Architecture Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organisation walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, and in some cases may be priortisied for removal.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that individuals and teams have identified as areas of innovation. Not yet recommended for production usage, we are looking at ASSESS technologies to assess any potential benefits that they may being.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams in Platforms and Architecture to pick the best 
technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, 
to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. 
Our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using in their projects.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by the Platforms and Architecture Developer Community &mdash; technology ratings 
are sourced as a group, wuth stakeholders in Technical Architecture and SLT
engaged to ensure organisational validity. 
Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and 
agreed in the meetings. The Tech Radar depends on active participation and input from all engineering 
teams in Platforms and Architecture.
